responding to ms james criticisms mr pugh said: the structure of unelected quangos is under review and we have made it clear that further announcements are due shortly  comparing the welsh assembly government to hitlers germany is a crass and ignorant response to a real issue about democratic accountability  ms james whose father was welsh was born in melbourne where her parents worked in the theatre she moved to powys nearly 20 years ago where she works from her studio near llangadfan she has won a number of arts prizes including the wales open in 1989 and the mostyn open in 1991 \",\n          \"car giant hit by mercedes slump a slump in profitability at luxury car maker mercedes has prompted a big drop in profits at parent daimlerchrysler  the german us carmaker saw fourth quarter operating profits fall to 785m euros ($1bn) from 2 4bn euros in 2003 mercedes benzs woes  its profits slid to just 20m euros  obscured a strong performance from the chrysler group whose returns met market expectations mercedes faces fierce competition in the luxury car sector from bmw and but hopes to revive its fortunes by 2006  mercedes profits over the period compared unfavourably with 2003s 784m euro figure and were well below analyst expectations of 374m euros for the year as a whole its operating profits fell 46% to 1 6bn euros sales of mercedes brands fell 2% as demand cooled while revenues were affected by the weakness of the us dollar  the carmaker blamed the fall in profits on high launch costs for new models and losses from its mercedes smart mini car range mercedes is hoping to increase productivity by 3bn euros having negotiated 500m euros in annual savings with german workers last year the firm said it was determined to retain mercedes position as the worlds most successful luxury brand however daimlerchryslers shares fell 1 5% on the news  while all these divisions are doing well the big worries continue to surround mercedes benz  michael rabb an analyst with bank sal oppenheim told reuters  in contrast chrysler enjoyed a 5% annual increase in unit sales while revenues  calculated in us dollars  rose 10% the us division  whose marques include dodge and jeep  transformed a full year operating loss of 506m euros in 2003 into a 1 4bn euros profit last year  overall daimlerchrysler saw worldwide vehicle sales rise 8% to 4 7 million in 2004 while total revenues added 4% to 142bn euros chryslers strong performance helped the worlds fifth largest carmaker boost net income by 400m euros to 2 5bn euros  the year 2004 shows that our strategy works well  even in such a challenging competitive environment  said jurgen schrempp daimlerchryslers chairman daimlerchrysler took a 475m euro hit in costs stemming from a defects scandal at its joint venture japanese subsidiary fuso daimlerchrysler last week agreed a compensation package with partner mitsubishi motors which will see it buy out its stake in fuso looking forward daimerchryslers profits are expected to be slightly higher in 2005 however it is expecting significant improvements in profitability in 2006 as a result of a major investment in the mercedes product range \",\n          \"brits debate over urban music joss stone a 17 year old soul singer from devon beat dizzee rascal jamelia lemar and the streets to win best british urban act at the brit awards her victory has reignited the debate about what urban music is    im not really comfortable with the word urban its a word thats been manufactured in this country and america to describe black music the word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that its wrong how far are the brits removed from inner city music and what people are doing? its so far removed that i dont expect them to get it bang on the music industry isnt championing music from our particular genre very well anyway people dont feel like thats anything to do with us i dont feel like urban musics just been celebrated by [joss stone] winning or her being nominated or by the brits acknowledging that theres an urban music scene because its all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day its not really relevant if joss stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who shes signed to then so be it its got nothing to do with whats really going on   urban as a genre is very broad if you look underneath urban there are a number of core elements that include hip hop r&b garage and into that obviously comes soul joss stone is a soul artist her first album was called the soul sessions so urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of sub genres and there are offshoots of all of those joss stone has had amazing success [in the us] given that shes a uk artist what has really captured everybodys imagination is that here you have a 17 year old from devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really really good tunes and she looks good  i think thats whats done it  the award for best british urban act was voted for by viewers of mtv base   i dont think joss was not a worthy winner she makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban the fact that shes from devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and shes literally rural the great thing about urban music is that theres a big range if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain i think thats where you can call it urban  thats where this new sub category or uber category has come from joss stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer but you couldnt argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions  it is coming from somewhere genuine it has to come across as real thats the only cut off point we have here and thats the only way by which we judge people   what urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multi cultural britain then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion if joss stone can be accepted within the urban music community i think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too race doesnt make a difference if everyone is included out of all the awards dished out yesterday im still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or award   a type of music (especially street music) that originates from a city and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life  she might not be urban but when did r&b become the hip hop tainted thing it is now? r&b stands for rhythm and blues remember! that joss stone is rubbish is certain if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music (i think probably should include hip hop soul & funk at least but not rock or pop) this year its the streets although dizzee rascal stakes a good claim she definitely deserved to win a prize joss stones albums are quite simply amazing easily better than anything else that was released last year this whole debate about what is urban what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who werent nominated or didnt win i cant see why people cant just congratulate her for the talent that she is  she did deserve it but i agree with the comments about urban music its a stupid phrase and particularly british in the states they tend to use hip hop and r&b if i say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what im talking about very strange  whats in a name? a rose by any other name etc  if people want to call it urban why not? if we really analysed it the term dance music is misleading because it doesnt describe everything you can dance to  whilst i agree that the term urban is open to interpretation it strikes me as simply weird that joss stone has won urban to me is what i hear being played in parties in the inner cities  i live in brixton and have never heard the soul sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any parties ive been to good luck to joss stone lets celebrate her victory  lets also question why with artists so successful and talented as jamelia lemar kanye west dizzee rascal alicia keys and outkast  we didnt see a single black artist on stage collecting an award  so what youre saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isnt black and if it is then they shouldnt be acknowledged for it even if theyre pretty dam good at it? shes 17 has an amazing voice and won good on her oh but shes not black well lets make her feel real bad about it then how dare she! though hang on didnt the so called public vote on this one? this idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the 1940s and 50s in relation to what jazz was the media then called anything that had a swinging beat syncopated melody or soulful feeling jazz  much to the chagrin of the artists it would mean that blues would be put in the same mould as bebop  cool and ragtime  all very different styles at that time jazz was and remains such a massively misunderstood term and so what of urban music? in truth its a lazy term to categorise music that you dont really understand soul and garage are worlds apart musically (marvin gaye v tuff jam?) but no doubt have their connections if we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is rather than what it represents  i demand a prize for rural music! sucks to the cities its way better out here we have hay for one thing  excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely? i dont understand the point that ty is making if lemar who makes music which is less soulful than joss work won he might have said nothing (btw im black too) how can she be urban if she spent most of her life in the devon countryside? nonsense  i love joss to bits and dont care what her branding is  its amazing music full stop stop puting it all in brackets and lets just call it music and lets especially drop the black / urban tag  nearly all music came from black origin this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour  surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is (historically) considered urban music irrelevent of the colour of their skin or where they originate from joss stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style just as someone from an inner city and indeed not from the usa could sing country music if that person was good at it and authentic in sound would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that style? the term urban in reference to a music genre in uk has developed in part from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo awards the very term music of black origin has confused and offended many people this is particularly strange given the existence of the asian music awards it appears that the use of black or white in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable the term urban therefore has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first black or white thereby rendering the issue colourblind the result is now a redundant new debate as to what urban also means perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strains of soul/rnb and hip hop one which does not also mean something else  as we have done with crunk  urban is just a word thats come about recently to describe black music thats become popular now the word wasnt even in use or common use five of six years ago its just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it  im in a band that has been called urban  and i despise the label id hate to think i belonged to any neat marketing niche because thats all it is ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider music of black origin these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity look at all the tv broadcasters unable to reach young people without condesending they simply play some urban music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music ignore the labels it is what it is just music  as a black man i think i agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives black people should lead the music they invented  we should stop calling a genre meaningless northing is meaningless the real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black? same thing with streets amy winehouse etc whos ever heard of terri walker or rhian benson  they are both 10 times better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music awards and i think mobos  but why not brits???? so what if joss stone won the urban awards her music is great soul and surely that is under the urban banner? what if the streets had won? would people be whining because mike skinner is white  it seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing else  urban is pc version for saying black music im not doubting ms stones talent but why didnt jamelia or lemar get a brit? this reminds me of what happened to craig david and soul ii soul in the past getting nominations are easy to get but picking up a brit seems to be the hardest thing  refreshing to see people making reasonable intelligent comments on any topic these days more power to you people! you have said it: there is music you like and music you dont like  who cares what label you put on it? that entire category was a mess how can you have people like dizzee rascal up against joss stone? its like putting eminem against bob geldof she should have been nominated for best british r & b act joss stone deserved to win an award for her talents but i dont think it was very urban of her to sing angels with robbie williams  urban is a nonsense term  music of black origin? well doesnt that include rock? music made in the inner cities? well almost all bands end up making music in london/manchester etc and doesnt that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities? it doesnt make any sense  why does music have to be put into a genre? its music you like it or you dont simple as that  i play in a heavy metal band we are urban music as far as im concerned we live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment; it therefore directly shapes what we write musically  urban seems to be the new name for all styles of black music why it needed a rebrand i dont know as the name is misleading oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know therefore more than fit the term urban yet as theyre a white rock band they wont be described as such  joss stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery  what other reason do they need to award her the brit? all this urban and other such categorisation is just the red tape of the music business and is best ignored  yeah she deserved it she is talented urban is a crap meaningless politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though theres only two kinds of music: good and bad \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"business\",\n          \"tech\",\n          \"sport\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

its so far removed that i dont expect them to get it bang on the music industry isnt championing music from our particular genre very well anyway people dont feel like thats anything to do with us i dont feel like urban musics just been celebrated by [joss stone] winning or her being nominated or by the brits acknowledging that theres an urban music scene because its all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day its not really relevant if joss stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who shes signed to then so be it its got nothing to do with whats really going on   urban as a genre is very broad if you look underneath urban there are a number of core elements that include hip hop r&b garage and into that obviously comes soul joss stone is a soul artist her first album was called the soul sessions so urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of sub genres and there are offshoots of all of those joss stone has had amazing success [in the us] given that shes a uk artist what has really captured everybodys imagination is that here you have a 17 year old from devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really really good tunes and she looks good  i think thats whats done it  the award for best british urban act was voted for by viewers of mtv base   i dont think joss was not a worthy winner she makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban the fact that shes from devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and shes literally rural the great thing about urban music is that theres a big range if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain i think thats where you can call it urban  thats where this new sub category or uber category has come from joss stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer but you couldnt argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions  it is coming from somewhere genuine it has to come across as real thats the only cut off point we have here and thats the only way by which we judge people   what urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multi cultural britain then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion if joss stone can be accepted within the urban music community i think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too race doesnt make a difference if everyone is included out of all the awards dished out yesterday im still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or award   a type of music (especially street music) that originates from a city and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life  she might not be urban but when did r&b become the hip hop tainted thing it is now? r&b stands for rhythm and blues remember! that joss stone is rubbish is certain if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music (i think probably should include hip hop soul & funk at least but not rock or pop) this year its the streets although dizzee rascal stakes a good claim she definitely deserved to win a prize joss stones albums are quite simply amazing easily better than anything else that was released last year this whole debate about what is urban what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who werent nominated or didnt win i cant see why people cant just congratulate her for the talent that she is  she did deserve it but i agree with the comments about urban music its a stupid phrase and particularly british in the states they tend to use hip hop and r&b if i say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what im talking about very strange  whats in a name? a rose by any other name etc  if people want to call it urban why not? if we really analysed it the term dance music is misleading because it doesnt describe everything you can dance to  whilst i agree that the term urban is open to interpretation it strikes me as simply weird that joss stone has won urban to me is what i hear being played in parties in the inner cities  i live in brixton and have never heard the soul sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any parties ive been to good luck to joss stone lets celebrate her victory  lets also question why with artists so successful and talented as jamelia lemar kanye west dizzee rascal alicia keys and outkast  we didnt see a single black artist on stage collecting an award  so what youre saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isnt black and if it is then they shouldnt be acknowledged for it even if theyre pretty dam good at it? shes 17 has an amazing voice and won good on her oh but shes not black well lets make her feel real bad about it then how dare she! though hang on didnt the so called public vote on this one? this idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the 1940s and 50s in relation to what jazz was the media then called anything that had a swinging beat syncopated melody or soulful feeling jazz  much to the chagrin of the artists it would mean that blues would be put in the same mould as bebop  cool and ragtime  all very different styles at that time jazz was and remains such a massively misunderstood term and so what of urban music? in truth its a lazy term to categorise music that you dont really understand soul and garage are worlds apart musically (marvin gaye v tuff jam?) but no doubt have their connections if we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is rather than what it represents  i demand a prize for rural music! sucks to the cities its way better out here we have hay for one thing  excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely? i dont understand the point that ty is making if lemar who makes music which is less soulful than joss work won he might have said nothing (btw im black too) how can she be urban if she spent most of her life in the devon countryside? nonsense  i love joss to bits and dont care what her branding is  its amazing music full stop stop puting it all in brackets and lets just call it music and lets especially drop the black / urban tag  nearly all music came from black origin this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour  surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is (historically) considered urban music irrelevent of the colour of their skin or where they originate from joss stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style just as someone from an inner city and indeed not from the usa could sing country music if that person was good at it and authentic in sound would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that style? the term urban in reference to a music genre in uk has developed in part from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo awards the very term music of black origin has confused and offended many people this is particularly strange given the existence of the asian music awards it appears that the use of black or white in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable the term urban therefore has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first black or white thereby rendering the issue colourblind the result is now a redundant new debate as to what urban also means perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strains of soul/rnb and hip hop one which does not also mean something else  as we have done with crunk  urban is just a word thats come about recently to describe black music thats become popular now the word wasnt even in use or common use five of six years ago its just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it  im in a band that has been called urban  and i despise the label id hate to think i belonged to any neat marketing niche because thats all it is ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider music of black origin these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity look at all the tv broadcasters unable to reach young people without condesending they simply play some urban music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music ignore the labels it is what it is just music  as a black man i think i agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives black people should lead the music they invented  we should stop calling a genre meaningless northing is meaningless the real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black? same thing with streets amy winehouse etc whos ever heard of terri walker or rhian benson  they are both 10 times better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music awards and i think mobos  but why not brits???? so what if joss stone won the urban awards her music is great soul and surely that is under the urban banner? what if the streets had won? would people be whining because mike skinner is white  it seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing else  urban is pc version for saying black music im not doubting ms stones talent but why didnt jamelia or lemar get a brit? this reminds me of what happened to craig david and soul ii soul in the past getting nominations are easy to get but picking up a brit seems to be the hardest thing  refreshing to see people making reasonable intelligent comments on any topic these days more power to you people! you have said it: there is music you like and music you dont like  who cares what label you put on it? that entire category was a mess how can you have people like dizzee rascal up against joss stone? its like putting eminem against bob geldof she should have been nominated for best british r & b act joss stone deserved to win an award for her talents but i dont think it was very urban of her to sing angels with robbie williams  urban is a nonsense term  music of black origin? well doesnt that include rock? music made in the inner cities? well almost all bands end up making music in london/manchester etc and doesnt that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities? it doesnt make any sense  why does music have to be put into a genre? its music you like it or you dont simple as that  i play in a heavy metal band we are urban music as far as im concerned we live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment; it therefore directly shapes what we write musically  urban seems to be the new name for all styles of black music why it needed a rebrand i dont know as the name is misleading oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know therefore more than fit the term urban yet as theyre a white rock band they wont be described as such  joss stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery  what other reason do they need to award her the brit? all this urban and other such categorisation is just the red tape of the music business and is best ignored  yeah she deserved it she is talented urban is a crap meaningless politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though theres only two kinds of music: good and bad \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"business\",\n          \"tech\",\n          \"sport\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean_data\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2119,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"kenyan school turns handhelds mbita point primary school western kenya students click away handheld computer stylus  exercises school textbooks digitised pilot project run eduvision looking ways use low cost computer systems get date information students currently stuck ancient textbooks matthew herren eduvision told bbc programme go digital non governmental organisation uses combination satellite radio handheld computers called e slates  e slates connect via wireless connection base station school turn connected satellite radio receiver data transmitted alongside audio signals  base station processes information satellite transmission turns form read handheld e slates  downloads satellite every day processes stream sorts content material destined users connected also stores hard disc  system cheaper installing maintaining internet connection conventional computer network mr herren says pros cons project  simple set satellite antenna roof school also one way connection getting feedback specific requests end users difficult  project still pilot stage eduvision staff ground attend teething problems linux based system  content divided visual information textual information questions users scroll sections independently  eduvision planning include audio video files system develops add content mr herren says would vastly increase opportunities available students currently negotiations take advantage project organised search site google digitise worlds largest university libraries  books public domain something like 15 million could put base stations manufacture every rural school africa would access libraries students oxford harvard currently project operating area mains electricity mr herren says eduvision already plans extend remote regions  plan put solar panel school base station e slates charge day children school take home night continue working  maciej sundra designed user interface e slates says projects ultimate goal levelling access knowledge around world  age people research using internet students still using textbooks?

responding to ms james criticisms mr pugh said: the structure of unelected quangos is under review and we have made it clear that further announcements are due shortly  comparing the welsh assembly government to hitlers germany is a crass and ignorant response to a real issue about democratic accountability  ms james whose father was welsh was born in melbourne where her parents worked in the theatre she moved to powys nearly 20 years ago where she works from her studio near llangadfan she has won a number of arts prizes including the wales open in 1989 and the mostyn open in 1991 \",\n          \"car giant hit by mercedes slump a slump in profitability at luxury car maker mercedes has prompted a big drop in profits at parent daimlerchrysler  the german us carmaker saw fourth quarter operating profits fall to 785m euros ($1bn) from 2 4bn euros in 2003 mercedes benzs woes  its profits slid to just 20m euros  obscured a strong performance from the chrysler group whose returns met market expectations mercedes faces fierce competition in the luxury car sector from bmw and but hopes to revive its fortunes by 2006  mercedes profits over the period compared unfavourably with 2003s 784m euro figure and were well below analyst expectations of 374m euros for the year as a whole its operating profits fell 46% to 1 6bn euros sales of mercedes brands fell 2% as demand cooled while revenues were affected by the weakness of the us dollar  the carmaker blamed the fall in profits on high launch costs for new models and losses from its mercedes smart mini car range mercedes is hoping to increase productivity by 3bn euros having negotiated 500m euros in annual savings with german workers last year the firm said it was determined to retain mercedes position as the worlds most successful luxury brand however daimlerchryslers shares fell 1 5% on the news  while all these divisions are doing well the big worries continue to surround mercedes benz  michael rabb an analyst with bank sal oppenheim told reuters  in contrast chrysler enjoyed a 5% annual increase in unit sales while revenues  calculated in us dollars  rose 10% the us division  whose marques include dodge and jeep  transformed a full year operating loss of 506m euros in 2003 into a 1 4bn euros profit last year  overall daimlerchrysler saw worldwide vehicle sales rise 8% to 4 7 million in 2004 while total revenues added 4% to 142bn euros chryslers strong performance helped the worlds fifth largest carmaker boost net income by 400m euros to 2 5bn euros  the year 2004 shows that our strategy works well  even in such a challenging competitive environment  said jurgen schrempp daimlerchryslers chairman daimlerchrysler took a 475m euro hit in costs stemming from a defects scandal at its joint venture japanese subsidiary fuso daimlerchrysler last week agreed a compensation package with partner mitsubishi motors which will see it buy out its stake in fuso looking forward daimerchryslers profits are expected to be slightly higher in 2005 however it is expecting significant improvements in profitability in 2006 as a result of a major investment in the mercedes product range \",\n          \"brits debate over urban music joss stone a 17 year old soul singer from devon beat dizzee rascal jamelia lemar and the streets to win best british urban act at the brit awards her victory has reignited the debate about what urban music is    im not really comfortable with the word urban its a word thats been manufactured in this country and america to describe black music the word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that its wrong how far are the brits removed from inner city music and what people are doing? its so far removed that i dont expect them to get it bang on the music industry isnt championing music from our particular genre very well anyway people dont feel like thats anything to do with us i dont feel like urban musics just been celebrated by [joss stone] winning or her being nominated or by the brits acknowledging that theres an urban music scene because its all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day its not really relevant if joss stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who shes signed to then so be it its got nothing to do with whats really going on   urban as a genre is very broad if you look underneath urban there are a number of core elements that include hip hop r&b garage and into that obviously comes soul joss stone is a soul artist her first album was called the soul sessions so urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of sub genres and there are offshoots of all of those joss stone has had amazing success [in the us] given that shes a uk artist what has really captured everybodys imagination is that here you have a 17 year old from devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really really good tunes and she looks good  i think thats whats done it  the award for best british urban act was voted for by viewers of mtv base   i dont think joss was not a worthy winner she makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban the fact that shes from devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and shes literally rural the great thing about urban music is that theres a big range if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain i think thats where you can call it urban  thats where this new sub category or uber category has come from joss stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer but you couldnt argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions  it is coming from somewhere genuine it has to come across as real thats the only cut off point we have here and thats the only way by which we judge people   what urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multi cultural britain then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion if joss stone can be accepted within the urban music community i think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too race doesnt make a difference if everyone is included out of all the awards dished out yesterday im still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or award   a type of music (especially street music) that originates from a city and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life  she might not be urban but when did r&b become the hip hop tainted thing it is now? r&b stands for rhythm and blues remember! that joss stone is rubbish is certain if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music (i think probably should include hip hop soul & funk at least but not rock or pop) this year its the streets although dizzee rascal stakes a good claim she definitely deserved to win a prize joss stones albums are quite simply amazing easily better than anything else that was released last year this whole debate about what is urban what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who werent nominated or didnt win i cant see why people cant just congratulate her for the talent that she is  she did deserve it but i agree with the comments about urban music its a stupid phrase and particularly british in the states they tend to use hip hop and r&b if i say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what im talking about very strange  whats in a name? a rose by any other name etc  if people want to call it urban why not? if we really analysed it the term dance music is misleading because it doesnt describe everything you can dance to  whilst i agree that the term urban is open to interpretation it strikes me as simply weird that joss stone has won urban to me is what i hear being played in parties in the inner cities  i live in brixton and have never heard the soul sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any parties ive been to good luck to joss stone lets celebrate her victory  lets also question why with artists so successful and talented as jamelia lemar kanye west dizzee rascal alicia keys and outkast  we didnt see a single black artist on stage collecting an award  so what youre saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isnt black and if it is then they shouldnt be acknowledged for it even if theyre pretty dam good at it? shes 17 has an amazing voice and won good on her oh but shes not black well lets make her feel real bad about it then how dare she! though hang on didnt the so called public vote on this one? this idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the 1940s and 50s in relation to what jazz was the media then called anything that had a swinging beat syncopated melody or soulful feeling jazz  much to the chagrin of the artists it would mean that blues would be put in the same mould as bebop  cool and ragtime  all very different styles at that time jazz was and remains such a massively misunderstood term and so what of urban music? in truth its a lazy term to categorise music that you dont really understand soul and garage are worlds apart musically (marvin gaye v tuff jam?) but no doubt have their connections if we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is rather than what it represents  i demand a prize for rural music! sucks to the cities its way better out here we have hay for one thing  excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely? i dont understand the point that ty is making if lemar who makes music which is less soulful than joss work won he might have said nothing (btw im black too) how can she be urban if she spent most of her life in the devon countryside? nonsense  i love joss to bits and dont care what her branding is  its amazing music full stop stop puting it all in brackets and lets just call it music and lets especially drop the black / urban tag  nearly all music came from black origin this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour  surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is (historically) considered urban music irrelevent of the colour of their skin or where they originate from joss stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style just as someone from an inner city and indeed not from the usa could sing country music if that person was good at it and authentic in sound would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that style? the term urban in reference to a music genre in uk has developed in part from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo awards the very term music of black origin has confused and offended many people this is particularly strange given the existence of the asian music awards it appears that the use of black or white in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable the term urban therefore has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first black or white thereby rendering the issue colourblind the result is now a redundant new debate as to what urban also means perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strains of soul/rnb and hip hop one which does not also mean something else  as we have done with crunk  urban is just a word thats come about recently to describe black music thats become popular now the word wasnt even in use or common use five of six years ago its just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it  im in a band that has been called urban  and i despise the label id hate to think i belonged to any neat marketing niche because thats all it is ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider music of black origin these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity look at all the tv broadcasters unable to reach young people without condesending they simply play some urban music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music ignore the labels it is what it is just music  as a black man i think i agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives black people should lead the music they invented  we should stop calling a genre meaningless northing is meaningless the real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black? same thing with streets amy winehouse etc whos ever heard of terri walker or rhian benson  they are both 10 times better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music awards and i think mobos  but why not brits???? so what if joss stone won the urban awards her music is great soul and surely that is under the urban banner? what if the streets had won? would people be whining because mike skinner is white  it seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing else  urban is pc version for saying black music im not doubting ms stones talent but why didnt jamelia or lemar get a brit? this reminds me of what happened to craig david and soul ii soul in the past getting nominations are easy to get but picking up a brit seems to be the hardest thing  refreshing to see people making reasonable intelligent comments on any topic these days more power to you people! you have said it: there is music you like and music you dont like  who cares what label you put on it? that entire category was a mess how can you have people like dizzee rascal up against joss stone? its like putting eminem against bob geldof she should have been nominated for best british r & b act joss stone deserved to win an award for her talents but i dont think it was very urban of her to sing angels with robbie williams  urban is a nonsense term  music of black origin? well doesnt that include rock? music made in the inner cities? well almost all bands end up making music in london/manchester etc and doesnt that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities? it doesnt make any sense  why does music have to be put into a genre? its music you like it or you dont simple as that  i play in a heavy metal band we are urban music as far as im concerned we live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment; it therefore directly shapes what we write musically  urban seems to be the new name for all styles of black music why it needed a rebrand i dont know as the name is misleading oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know therefore more than fit the term urban yet as theyre a white rock band they wont be described as such  joss stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery  what other reason do they need to award her the brit? all this urban and other such categorisation is just the red tape of the music business and is best ignored  yeah she deserved it she is talented urban is a crap meaningless politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though theres only two kinds of music: good and bad \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"business\",\n          \"tech\",\n          \"sport\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean_data\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2119,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"kenyan school turns handhelds mbita point primary school western kenya students click away handheld computer stylus  exercises school textbooks digitised pilot project run eduvision looking ways use low cost computer systems get date information students currently stuck ancient textbooks matthew herren eduvision told bbc programme go digital non governmental organisation uses combination satellite radio handheld computers called e slates  e slates connect via wireless connection base station school turn connected satellite radio receiver data transmitted alongside audio signals  base station processes information satellite transmission turns form read handheld e slates  downloads satellite every day processes stream sorts content material destined users connected also stores hard disc  system cheaper installing maintaining internet connection conventional computer network mr herren says pros cons project  simple set satellite antenna roof school also one way connection getting feedback specific requests end users difficult  project still pilot stage eduvision staff ground attend teething problems linux based system  content divided visual information textual information questions users scroll sections independently  eduvision planning include audio video files system develops add content mr herren says would vastly increase opportunities available students currently negotiations take advantage project organised search site google digitise worlds largest university libraries  books public domain something like 15 million could put base stations manufacture every rural school africa would access libraries students oxford harvard currently project operating area mains electricity mr herren says eduvision already plans extend remote regions  plan put solar panel school base station e slates charge day children school take home night continue working  maciej sundra designed user interface e slates says projects ultimate goal levelling access knowledge around world  age people research using internet students still using textbooks?

its so far removed that i dont expect them to get it bang on the music industry isnt championing music from our particular genre very well anyway people dont feel like thats anything to do with us i dont feel like urban musics just been celebrated by [joss stone] winning or her being nominated or by the brits acknowledging that theres an urban music scene because its all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day its not really relevant if joss stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who shes signed to then so be it its got nothing to do with whats really going on   urban as a genre is very broad if you look underneath urban there are a number of core elements that include hip hop r&b garage and into that obviously comes soul joss stone is a soul artist her first album was called the soul sessions so urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of sub genres and there are offshoots of all of those joss stone has had amazing success [in the us] given that shes a uk artist what has really captured everybodys imagination is that here you have a 17 year old from devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really really good tunes and she looks good  i think thats whats done it  the award for best british urban act was voted for by viewers of mtv base   i dont think joss was not a worthy winner she makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban the fact that shes from devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and shes literally rural the great thing about urban music is that theres a big range if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain i think thats where you can call it urban  thats where this new sub category or uber category has come from joss stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer but you couldnt argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions  it is coming from somewhere genuine it has to come across as real thats the only cut off point we have here and thats the only way by which we judge people   what urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multi cultural britain then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion if joss stone can be accepted within the urban music community i think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too race doesnt make a difference if everyone is included out of all the awards dished out yesterday im still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or award   a type of music (especially street music) that originates from a city and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life  she might not be urban but when did r&b become the hip hop tainted thing it is now? r&b stands for rhythm and blues remember! that joss stone is rubbish is certain if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music (i think probably should include hip hop soul & funk at least but not rock or pop) this year its the streets although dizzee rascal stakes a good claim she definitely deserved to win a prize joss stones albums are quite simply amazing easily better than anything else that was released last year this whole debate about what is urban what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who werent nominated or didnt win i cant see why people cant just congratulate her for the talent that she is  she did deserve it but i agree with the comments about urban music its a stupid phrase and particularly british in the states they tend to use hip hop and r&b if i say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what im talking about very strange  whats in a name? a rose by any other name etc  if people want to call it urban why not? if we really analysed it the term dance music is misleading because it doesnt describe everything you can dance to  whilst i agree that the term urban is open to interpretation it strikes me as simply weird that joss stone has won urban to me is what i hear being played in parties in the inner cities  i live in brixton and have never heard the soul sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any parties ive been to good luck to joss stone lets celebrate her victory  lets also question why with artists so successful and talented as jamelia lemar kanye west dizzee rascal alicia keys and outkast  we didnt see a single black artist on stage collecting an award  so what youre saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isnt black and if it is then they shouldnt be acknowledged for it even if theyre pretty dam good at it? shes 17 has an amazing voice and won good on her oh but shes not black well lets make her feel real bad about it then how dare she! though hang on didnt the so called public vote on this one? this idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the 1940s and 50s in relation to what jazz was the media then called anything that had a swinging beat syncopated melody or soulful feeling jazz  much to the chagrin of the artists it would mean that blues would be put in the same mould as bebop  cool and ragtime  all very different styles at that time jazz was and remains such a massively misunderstood term and so what of urban music? in truth its a lazy term to categorise music that you dont really understand soul and garage are worlds apart musically (marvin gaye v tuff jam?) but no doubt have their connections if we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is rather than what it represents  i demand a prize for rural music! sucks to the cities its way better out here we have hay for one thing  excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely? i dont understand the point that ty is making if lemar who makes music which is less soulful than joss work won he might have said nothing (btw im black too) how can she be urban if she spent most of her life in the devon countryside? nonsense  i love joss to bits and dont care what her branding is  its amazing music full stop stop puting it all in brackets and lets just call it music and lets especially drop the black / urban tag  nearly all music came from black origin this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour  surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is (historically) considered urban music irrelevent of the colour of their skin or where they originate from joss stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style just as someone from an inner city and indeed not from the usa could sing country music if that person was good at it and authentic in sound would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that style? the term urban in reference to a music genre in uk has developed in part from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo awards the very term music of black origin has confused and offended many people this is particularly strange given the existence of the asian music awards it appears that the use of black or white in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable the term urban therefore has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first black or white thereby rendering the issue colourblind the result is now a redundant new debate as to what urban also means perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strains of soul/rnb and hip hop one which does not also mean something else  as we have done with crunk  urban is just a word thats come about recently to describe black music thats become popular now the word wasnt even in use or common use five of six years ago its just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it  im in a band that has been called urban  and i despise the label id hate to think i belonged to any neat marketing niche because thats all it is ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider music of black origin these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity look at all the tv broadcasters unable to reach young people without condesending they simply play some urban music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music ignore the labels it is what it is just music  as a black man i think i agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives black people should lead the music they invented  we should stop calling a genre meaningless northing is meaningless the real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black? same thing with streets amy winehouse etc whos ever heard of terri walker or rhian benson  they are both 10 times better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music awards and i think mobos  but why not brits???? so what if joss stone won the urban awards her music is great soul and surely that is under the urban banner? what if the streets had won? would people be whining because mike skinner is white  it seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing else  urban is pc version for saying black music im not doubting ms stones talent but why didnt jamelia or lemar get a brit? this reminds me of what happened to craig david and soul ii soul in the past getting nominations are easy to get but picking up a brit seems to be the hardest thing  refreshing to see people making reasonable intelligent comments on any topic these days more power to you people! you have said it: there is music you like and music you dont like  who cares what label you put on it? that entire category was a mess how can you have people like dizzee rascal up against joss stone? its like putting eminem against bob geldof she should have been nominated for best british r & b act joss stone deserved to win an award for her talents but i dont think it was very urban of her to sing angels with robbie williams  urban is a nonsense term  music of black origin? well doesnt that include rock? music made in the inner cities? well almost all bands end up making music in london/manchester etc and doesnt that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities? it doesnt make any sense  why does music have to be put into a genre? its music you like it or you dont simple as that  i play in a heavy metal band we are urban music as far as im concerned we live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment; it therefore directly shapes what we write musically  urban seems to be the new name for all styles of black music why it needed a rebrand i dont know as the name is misleading oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know therefore more than fit the term urban yet as theyre a white rock band they wont be described as such  joss stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery  what other reason do they need to award her the brit? all this urban and other such categorisation is just the red tape of the music business and is best ignored  yeah she deserved it she is talented urban is a crap meaningless politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though theres only two kinds of music: good and bad \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"business\",\n          \"tech\",\n          \"sport\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean_data\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2119,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"kenyan school turns handhelds mbita point primary school western kenya students click away handheld computer stylus  exercises school textbooks digitised pilot project run eduvision looking ways use low cost computer systems get date information students currently stuck ancient textbooks matthew herren eduvision told bbc programme go digital non governmental organisation uses combination satellite radio handheld computers called e slates  e slates connect via wireless connection base station school turn connected satellite radio receiver data transmitted alongside audio signals  base station processes information satellite transmission turns form read handheld e slates  downloads satellite every day processes stream sorts content material destined users connected also stores hard disc  system cheaper installing maintaining internet connection conventional computer network mr herren says pros cons project  simple set satellite antenna roof school also one way connection getting feedback specific requests end users difficult  project still pilot stage eduvision staff ground attend teething problems linux based system  content divided visual information textual information questions users scroll sections independently  eduvision planning include audio video files system develops add content mr herren says would vastly increase opportunities available students currently negotiations take advantage project organised search site google digitise worlds largest university libraries  books public domain something like 15 million could put base stations manufacture every rural school africa would access libraries students oxford harvard currently project operating area mains electricity mr herren says eduvision already plans extend remote regions  plan put solar panel school base station e slates charge day children school take home night continue working  maciej sundra designed user interface e slates says projects ultimate goal levelling access knowledge around world  age people research using internet students still using textbooks?
